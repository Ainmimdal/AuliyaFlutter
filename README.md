## INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Preamble

With the rapid advancement of mobile technology, digital applications have become an integral part of daily life, including education, habit formation, and family management. Mobile applications offer interactive and accessible platforms that can support parents in guiding children’s routines and behaviors. For Muslim families, there is an increasing need for solutions that not only utilize modern technology but also align with **Islamic values and Shariah principles**.

Children’s character development (akhlaq) and consistency in performing daily good deeds such as prayer, reciting duʿāʾ, and practicing good manners are fundamental aspects of Islamic upbringing. However, traditional approaches such as paper-based star charts, verbal reminders, or manual tracking are often difficult to maintain, lack long-term engagement, and provide limited visibility of progress.

Therefore, this project proposes **Auliya**, a **cross-platform Islamic gamified habit tracker** designed to help parents encourage positive habits in children through structured tracking, visual motivation, and reward-based reinforcement. The application integrates Islamic teachings with modern mobile technology to create a family-friendly, ethical, and engaging digital experience.

## 1.2 Problem Description

### 1.2.1 Background of the Problem

Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children’s habits and moral values from an early age. In Muslim households, parents aim to instill habits such as performing daily prayers, reading the Qur’an, reciting duʿāʾ, and developing good manners. Despite these goals, many parents face challenges due to busy schedules, multiple children, and lack of effective monitoring tools.

Most existing habit-tracking applications available in the market are **generic**, focusing on productivity, fitness, or personal goals. These applications are not designed specifically for children and often do not incorporate **Islamic values**. Furthermore, some applications apply gamification techniques that are unsuitable from an Islamic perspective, such as gambling-like reward systems or excessive competition.

As a result, there is a clear gap for a **Shariah-compliant, child-focused, and parent-controlled habit tracking application** that integrates Islamic education with ethical gamification.

### 1.2.2 Problem Statement

Traditional methods used by parents to encourage and track children’s good habits are often ineffective due to lack of engagement, difficulty in maintaining consistency, and limited progress tracking. Existing digital solutions fail to address Islamic values adequately and do not provide appropriate parental control or ethical reinforcement mechanisms.

Hence, there is a need to develop an application that:
- Helps parents consistently monitor children’s daily good deeds
- Motivates children through positive and ethical reinforcement
- Integrates Islamic educational content
- Ensures Shariah-compliant and family-friendly design

## 1.3 Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. To develop a **cross-platform mobile application** using Flutter for Android and iOS.
2. To design a **gamified habit tracking system** that motivates children to perform daily good deeds.
3. To provide **parent-managed child profiles** for individualized habit monitoring.
4. To implement a **star-based reward system** that reinforces positive behavior.
5. To integrate **Islamic educational content**, such as daily duʿāʾ, in a child-friendly format.
6. To visualize progress using **charts and analytics**.
7. To ensure the application follows **Shariah-compliant, ethical, and privacy-focused principles**.

## 1.4 Project Scope

### 1.4.1 Scope

This project focuses on the development of a **mobile application prototype** with the following scope:

- User authentication using Google Sign-In
- Parent dashboard for managing multiple child profiles
- Daily habit tracking (Akhlaq Harian)
- Gamification elements including levels, stars, and rewards
- Daily and bonus reward redemption system
- Islamic duʿāʾ collection with translations
- Progress visualization through charts
- Backend integration using Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

The application is designed as a **supportive educational tool** and does not replace formal Islamic education.
As part of the project scope, UI/UX designs and wireframes are created using Figma to visualize the application layout, navigation flow, and user interactions. These designs serve as a reference for implementation and are presented in a later chapter of this report.


### 1.4.2 Target Users

The primary target users are **Muslim parents or guardians** aged between 25 and 45 years who wish to guide and monitor their children’s daily habits. The secondary users are **children aged 3 to 15 years**, who interact with the application through visual feedback and rewards under parental supervision.

## 1.5 Project Constraints

The project is subject to the following constraints:

- Limited development time within the academic semester
- Dependency on internet connectivity for Firebase services
- Limited scope due to academic and resource constraints
- Requirement to comply with Islamic and ethical guidelines
- Learning curve associated with Flutter and Firebase integration

---

## 1.6 Project Stages

The development of the Auliya application is divided into the following stages:

1. Requirement analysis and project planning  
2. UI/UX design and navigation flow  
3. Backend setup and Firebase integration  
4. Core feature implementation  
5. Testing and debugging  
6. Final documentation and presentation
